# playwrightAutomationFramework

The configuration for testing is set so that screenshots are captured only when failures occur

```
use: {
trace: "retain-on-failure",
browserName: "chromium",
screenshot: "on",
headless: true,
},
```

Working on currently adding more tests. Will include the following features in the framework soon:

-   API Testing
-   Cross browser testing
-   BDD Capabilities
-   End to end testing including UI and API flows
